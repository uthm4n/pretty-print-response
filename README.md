# pretty-print-response
Pretty print the response of an API call in Morpheus

### Note: make README better
- The HTTP response from calling the API is not in pretty format by default if you call it manually using the autogenerated Python code or via Morpheus itself 
- This specific API call creates a new user in the UI and gives you a prettified JSON view of the output
- You can copy and paste line 20 and line 21 to the end of the auto-generated Python code in the docs ([https://apidocs.morpheusdata.com/](https://apidocs.morpheusdata.com/)) to see the JSON presented in a more readable format
