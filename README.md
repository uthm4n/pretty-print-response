# pretty-print-response
Pretty print the response of an API call in Morpheus

Note: make README better
- The HTTP response from calling the API is not in pretty format by default if you call it manually using the Python code or via Morpheus itself 
- This specific API call creates a new user in the UI and gives you a prettified JSON view of the output
